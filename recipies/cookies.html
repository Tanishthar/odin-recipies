        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
            </li>

            <li> 
                <strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.
            </li>
                
            <li>
                <strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <strong>Chocolate chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Nuts</strong> (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.
            </li>
        </ul>
